## 🚨 Important Notes

### 🔴 CRITICAL - Do Not Skip
1. **Customize templates before use** - Generic templates are not legally compliant
2. **Enable HTTPS/TLS** - Required for data in transit protection
3. **Publish privacy policy** - Required before collecting any user data
4. **Test user deletion** - Verify accounts are properly anonymized
5. **Document your legal basis** - Required for audit compliance

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Using template privacy policies without customization
- ❌ Collecting data without informing users
- ❌ Ignoring data subject access requests
- ❌ Storing passwords in plaintext (WulfVault handles this correctly)
- ❌ Not reporting breaches within 72 hours
- ❌ Transferring data outside EU without safeguards
- ❌ Not documenting legal basis for processing

### 💡 Best Practices
- ✅ Appoint a privacy champion even if DPO not required
- ✅ Conduct privacy impact assessments for new features
- ✅ Review third-party integrations for GDPR compliance
- ✅ Keep audit logs for at least 90 days (configurable)
- ✅ Document all data protection decisions
- ✅ Train staff on GDPR requirements annually
- ✅ Test breach notification procedures
